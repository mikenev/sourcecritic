# Source Critique

---
## What is it?
A simple source code review and comment utility. It allows users to leave feedback and comments on any type of text file and let other viewers see the feedback.

---
## Who is the target audience?
Mainly used to review source code for undergrad programming courses.

---
## Why use it?
Beginning programmers need feedback on the programs and the assignments they are completing. Getting that feedback can be difficult since other tools do not cater very well to these students. A simple tool that doesn't depend on other services (source control, diff files, authentication systems, etc.) is useful in this situation.

## What other options are there?
* Google Docs - Doesn't format source code very well. Also difficult to use with multiple source files. Not easy to work with plain text files.
* MS Word - Neither online nor offline versions format source code very well. Difficult to use with multiple source files.
* PasteBin - Lets you paste code, but doesn't allow for feedback. Only meant for one file/code snippet.
* GitHub Gist - Allows multiple files and comments. Doesn't easily tie comments to a particular file/line of code. Difficult to scroll through when there are many files.
